Example problem, to get you warmed up

Given an input integer, output two times that integer. End with newline. (NOTE: Nearly every problem expects the student to follow the good practice of always ending output with a newline, so the newline won't be explicitly stated). Do not prompt the user to enter the integer; just read the integer. Ex: If the input is 3, the output should be 6.

HINTS:

    A series of hints would normally appear here. This problem is very simple so not many hints appear, and they are very basic.

    Read the integer into a variable using the Scanner variable scnr, as in: userInt = scnr.nextInt(); Then, use System.out.println() to output 2 times that integer and end the output with a newline.

    When using "Develop" mode, remember to pre-enter the needed input values. Otherwise you may get weird behavior when running.
